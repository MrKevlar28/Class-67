Once upon a time a man saw a jug of water. He was very negative abt everything he said and called it half empty. One day when he was served a half empty glass of water he screamed with anger. His friend then told him that it was not only half empty its also half full. He then realized about not only the negativity in life but also the positve part.
The End.....
